Several studies point out the importance of interaction in Information Visualization (InfoVis) field to the success of good data visualization. And this interest is compounded by the growth and complexity of data electronically stored in various areas of knowledge. The researches in interaction applied in InfoVis have encouraged the use of non-conventional interfaces, besides the traditional keyboard and mouse, such as voice commands, eye tracking, gesture controls, brain-computer interfaces, among others. This work aims to present aspects of design, development and evaluation of an interface for voice commands to interact in InfoVis 3D applications. The InfoVis technique used as usage scenario is the 3D Scatterplot. In addition to speech recognition is used Coruja Software, which uses the recognition engine Julius, to support Brazilian Portuguese. Finally, usability tests are presented for evaluation of the interface and interaction proposed. The tests used the approach of user tasks to evaluate InfoVis sub-tasks in the application such as: configuration, filter selection, among others. And to perform subjective workload assessments was used NASA Task Load-Index methodology, which identifies the user's total workload in the different tasks performed. These tests showed the interface efficacy, having a time difference relative to the mouse of 24%, and a workload 26% above the mouseâ€™s workload.
